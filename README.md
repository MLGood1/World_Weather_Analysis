# World_Weather_Analysis

## OVERVIEW

During this analysis I acted as a data analyst for PlanMyTrip app and was asked to create a new product for the travel app that involved three components.

•	The first component entailed retrieving weather data from an API call to OpenWeatherMap based on the desired ideal temperature for users of the PlanMyTrip app seeking vacation destinations. 

•	Once a list of cities with the desired temperature range was generated, I then performed an API call to Google Maps to generate a list of hotels that corresponded to the vacation destinations from the first step.  I then mapped those destinations with pop up markers.

•	Lastly, using the Google Directions API, I created a travel itinerary that showed a route between four cities that could be visited from the customer’s possible travel destination.
